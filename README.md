We will use a simple dataset to evaluate the impact of the opening of a new Walmart on the sales a local grocery store. Suppose that you have been hired as a consultant for the local grocery store. Store management is worried since Wal-Mart has entered the market by opening a "Wal-Mart Super-center" only 3 miles away. The management is interested in analyzing the impact on store sales after Wal-Mart's entry. 

For the analysis, management has given you access to 50 weeks of sales data before the entry of Walmart and 50 weeks after. Please download and look at the data in “Walmart_Data.csv” from Canvas.

The dataset has the following variables:

WEEK: Week number 
Sales: weekly sales
Promotion: Index of weekly promotion activity - higher promotion index indicates more products on promotion in the store
Feature: Index of feature advertising activity - higher feature advertising index indicates more feature advertising
Walmart: A categorical variable =“No”  in the weeks before the Walmart opens, and “Present” in the weeks before the Walmart opens
Holiday: Holiday = “Yes” during major holiday weeks, and “No” for non-holiday weeks
